Cultural Foundation of Tinos’ audience and, by extension, the broader Greek public, the works of three established Canadian artists—Allyson Glenn, Colleen Heslin and Ronald Moppett--as part of the 150th anniversary celebrations of the founding of Canada (1867-2017). All three artists are at the forefront of Canada’s artistic community by pushing forward the taken for granted boundaries and hierarchies of painting, fact that is evident in the reception of their much-awarded practice. In visually innovative ways they speak of and depict the physical vastness of the Canadian landscape with large powerful works, the same works can withstand the challenges of the Aegean Sea—endless blue horizon, relentless light, myriad of stories buried in its depths.\"","Office Constituency":"CALGARY-MOUNTAIN VIEW","Year":2017,"Month":4,"Quater":2},{"Fiscal Year":"2017-2018","Recipient Name":"Burns Visual Arts Society of Calgary","AFA Grant Type":"Organization Operating","Approval Date":"2017-07-07","Approved Amount":9073,"Funding Opportunity":"Community Support Organizations","Project Description":"","Office Constituency":"CALGARY-FORT","Year":2017,"Month":6,"Quater":3},{"Fiscal Year":"2017-2018","Recipient Name":"St. Albert Singers Guild","AFA Grant Type":"Organization Operating","Approval Date":"2018-03-13","Approved Amount":9077,"Funding Opportunity":"Community Performing Arts Organizations","Project Description":"","Office Constituency":"ST.

SpaceFinder Alberta links organizations with space to rent in our communities with those who need creative space. SpaceFinder Alberta is free to list, free to search. This project will give all Albertans access to this online marketplace and provide policy-makers with province-wide data. Less creative space throughout Alberta will go unused less often, resulting in more animation of our communities, more time resources for organizations to use for their core mandates, and more revenue for venues. From Fall 2016 through Winder 2019, Calgary Arts Development proposes to train and support cultural workers in helping venues create listings and in marketing SpaceFinder Alberta to people seeking space in communities across Alberta.\"","Office Constituency":"CALGARY-BUFFALO","Year":2017,"Month":4,"Quater":2},{"Fiscal Year":"2017-2018","Recipient Name":"CALGARY MULTICULTURAL ARTS SOCIETY","AFA Grant Type":"Organization Project","Approval Date":"2018-03-13","Approved Amount":50243,"Funding Opportunity":"Arts Presenting","Project Description":"AP 2016-17 CMAS","Office Constituency":"CALGARY-BUFFALO","Year":2018,"Month":2,"Quater":1},{"Fiscal Year":"2016-2017","Recipient Name":"Events Edmonton","AFA Grant Type":"Organization Project","Approval Date":"2017-03-17","Approved Amount":50306,"Funding Opportunity":"Arts Presenting","Project Description":"Taste of Edmonton","Office Constituency":"EDMONTON-CENTRE","Year":2017,"Month":2,"Quater":1},{"Fiscal Year":"2017-2018","Recipient Name":"Society of Northern Alberta Print-Artists","AFA Grant Type":"Organization Operating","Approval Date":"2017-07-07","Approved Amount":50490,"Funding Opportunity":"Public Art Galleries","Project Description":"","Office Constituency":"EDMONTON-CENTRE","Year":2017,"Month":6,"Quater":3},{"Fiscal Year":"2016-2017","Recipient Name":"Alberta Choral Federation (Association)","AFA Grant Type":"Organization Operating","Approval Date":"2016-07-08","Approved Amount":50546,"Funding Opportunity":"Community Support Organizations","Project Description":"","Office Constituency":"EDMONTON-GLENORA","Year":2016,"Month":6,"Quater":3},{"Fiscal Year":"2015-2016","Recipient Name":"The Friends of University Hospitals","AFA Grant Type":"Organization Operating","Approval Date":"2016-02-25","Approved Amount":50589,"Funding Opportunity":"Community Support Organizations","Project Description":"","Office Constituency":"EDMONTON-RIVERVIEW","Year":2016,"Month":1,"Quater":1},{"Fiscal Year":"2016-2017","Recipient Name":"Red Deer College","AFA Grant Type":"Organization Project","Approval Date":"2016-06-03","Approved Amount":51153,"Funding Opportunity":"Summer Schools","Project Description":"Teen Film and Game 2016","Office Constituency":"RED DEER-SOUTH","Year":2016,"Month":5,"Quater":2},{"Fiscal Year":"2016-2017","Recipient Name":"Canmore Folk Music Festival Society","AFA Grant Type":"Organization Project","Approval Date":"2017-03-17","Approved Amount":51236,"Funding Opportunity":"Arts Presenting","Project Description":"2016-17 Festival","Office Constituency":"BANFF-COCHRANE","Year":2017,"Month":2,"Quater":1},{"Fiscal Year":"2015-2016","Recipient Name":"Association Franco-Albertaine de L'UniTheatre","AFA Grant Type":"Organization Operating","Approval Date":"2015-05-21","Approved Amount":51690,"Funding Opportunity":"Professional Performing Arts Organizations","Project Description":"","Office Constituency":"EDMONTON-GOLD BAR","Year":2015,"Month":4,"Quater":2},{"Fiscal Year":"2017-2018","Recipient Name":"Pro Coro Society - Edmonton","AFA Grant Type":"Organization Operating","Approval Date":"2017-05-26","Approved Amount":52561,"Funding Opportunity":"Professional Performing Arts Organizations","Project Description":"","Office Constituency":"EDMONTON-CENTRE","Year":2017,"Month":4,"Quater":2},{"Fiscal Year":"2017-2018","Recipient Name":"SOUTHERN ALBERTA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY STUDENTS' ASSOCIATION","AFA Grant Type":"Organization Project","Approval Date":"2018-03-13","Approved Amount":52738,"Funding Opportunity":"Arts Presenting","Project Description":"SAITSA Arts Application for 2016-2017","Office Constituency":"CALGARY-MOUNTAIN VIEW","Year":2018,"Month":2,"Quater":1},{"Fiscal Year":"2017-2018","Recipient Name":"The Banff Lake Louise Tourism Bureau","AFA Grant Type":"Organization Project","Approval Date":"2018-03-13","Approved Amount":52816,"Funding Opportunity":"Arts Presenting","Project Description":"Banff & Lake Louise Tourism 2016-2017","Office Constituency":"BANFF-COCHRANE","Year":2018,"Month":2,"Quater":1},{"Fiscal Year":"2017-2018","Recipient Name":"The Friends of University Hospitals","AFA Grant Type":"Organization Operating","Approval Date":"2017-07-07","Approved Amount":52954,"Funding Opportunity":"Community Support Organizations","Project Description":"","Office Constituency":"EDMONTON-RIVERVIEW","Year":2017,"Month":6,"Quater":3},{"Fiscal Year":"2017-2018","Recipient Name":"Penguin Eggs Magazine Ltd.","AFA Grant Type":"Organization Operating","Approval Date":"2017-09-12","Approved Amount":53472,"Funding Opportunity":"Cultural Industries Operating","Project Description":"","Office Constituency":"EDMONTON-GLENORA","Year":2017,"Month":8,"Quater":3},{"Fiscal Year":"2017-2018","Recipient Name":"Friends of the Arden Theatre Society","AFA Grant Type":"Organization Project","Approval Date":"2018-03-13","Approved Amount":53743,"Funding Opportunity":"Arts Presenting","Project Description":"Friends of the Arden Theatre Society - 2017 application","Office Constituency":"ST.
